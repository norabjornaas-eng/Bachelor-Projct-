Bachelor Project – API Vulnerability Testing

This repository contains my bachelor project in cybersecurity, completed as part of a student project in collaboration with SmartSec Lab.

The project focuses on vulnerability-oriented testing of RESTful APIs using the VoAPI2 framework.
The goal is to evaluate how automated testing can identify security weaknesses in real API systems.

The APIs tested in this project are:

Appwrite

Gitea

Jellyfin

Project description

Modern applications rely heavily on RESTful APIs, which makes them an important attack surface.
In this project, we used an automated vulnerability testing framework to systematically test APIs and analyze their security behavior.

The work included:

Setting up the test environment

Preparing OpenAPI specifications

Running automated security tests

Analyzing the output

Comparing the results with earlier experiments

Results

The testing identified several security-relevant issues, including:

SSRF-related behavior in Appwrite

Possible input validation and injection weaknesses

Data exposure caused by API misconfigurations

Sensitive administrative endpoints in Gitea

Detailed findings are stored in the results folder.
